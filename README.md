`http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/index.html`

**You can also use Postman and test this API using a ready-made collection.** 
**Here are all the requests that can be sent to my application's endpoints and receive valid responses.**

`Book Store.postman_collection.json`
> You can download the collection by following these instructions:
> 1. In Postman, in the upper left corner, find and click the `Import button`
